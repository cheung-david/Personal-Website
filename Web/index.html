                    The cartoonish theme of this design was chosen in relation to the work environment. In this, case, the target audience was specifically for students in the class. We felt that this design concept would give the teenage age group a more pleasant and familiar environment while also applying important aspects of web design. By choosing a more creative approach, it convinces students to  spend more time to appreciate the site and holds their attention  as compared to a plainer, business styled design. Of course, this type of design is not designated for all age groups and specialized for high school students and below (youth). In addition, a creative and interactive website can give new students inspiration and a goal to work towards while making it look fun.  Being able to see an example of a site with interactive features can be motivating because it reassures it's viewers that there is more to web design than stationary images. The best part is  you do not need to be a professional to do so.
At first the website was designed with an extreme cartoonish look. After discussing and getting feedback from the team, I adjusted the site to correspond with their suggestions. Andy organized and suggested changes while Jason helped by writing the Java Script for the Leacock website and integrating the slide show and some icons and links. After hearing their suggestions, I made an attempt to make it look formal while keeping a creative approach. After that, Jason added a slide show with Pokémon gifs on it. He also adjusted the style-sheet slightly and added link attachments and labels to each of the images. Upon seeing Pokémon avatars, it gave me the idea to make a Pokémon themed website design instead due to the fact that the splash screen was made for the class and they all know what Pokémon is. Upon this change Andy was not satisfied with the design outline and suggested a lighter shade of colours and positional changes of objects because he felt that it appeared slightly gloomy, I agreed. After reworking the site and changing the colour scheme, it did indeed look much better and welcoming. But I felt something was missing as agreed by the team. So I decided to integrate more JQuery and adjust and make new style sheets for each individual feature to make the site more interactive and fun. The poke ball transition consists of an opacity decrement and increment of two different layers simultaneously on hover to creating a “warping effect”.  Whereas the vertical side bar is based off the functions of a pokedex which is intended to expand and overlay to give additional information whilst staying on the same page.   The result was satisfying as what was visualized was accomplished.  We wanted the every section of the website to be centered. After numerous attempts of experimenting, I discovered that each section of the site should be broken down to sections. (eg. Navigation, Background, Content, Core, Header) This is a more professional approach and allows ease when adjusting and centering all the separate contents of the site with respect to the page size allowing it to be compatible for any screen size. The date/time script was extracted from the Stephen Leacock website which was written by Jason and adjusted to show the date/time and day appropriately. In addition, glowing text was added to make it stand out and easier to read.
